[["intro-to-regression.html", "Week 2 Intro to Regression Data Screening 2.1 Conducting a Multiple Regression", " Week 2 Intro to Regression The packages that I used for this weeks exercises are as follows: library(tidyverse) # For general functions library(haven) # For importing SPSS file into R Inporting data: lab2_raw &lt;- read_sav(&quot;data/lab2data.sav&quot;); Data Screening Quick way to see if any variables have missing data apply(is.na(lab2_raw), 2, which); ## $id ## integer(0) ## ## $raceab ## integer(0) ## ## $socialid ## integer(0) ## ## $selfest ## integer(0) ## ## $CBT ## integer(0) ## ## $anxiety ## [1] 59 And we can see that the observation 59 has missing data for Anxiety. For the sake of our analysis we will just remove this observation (Which is what I believe we did in the Lab); lab2 &lt;- lab2_raw %&gt;% na.omit() sum(is.na(lab2$anxiety)) # Just testing that we did remove the NA ## [1] 0 2.1 Conducting a Multiple Regression I havent yet found a way to have all the regression output as nicely formatted as it appears in SPSS. The closest I could get was to save the regression output in a separate APA formatted document, which I achieved with using the function apa.reg.table located in the apaTables package. The APA output is saved in a folder called output which you can access from gitHub if you so desire. 2.1.1 Descriptives table1::table1(~anxiety + raceab + socialid + selfest + CBT, data = lab2) Overall(N=81) anxiety Mean (SD) 26.1 (2.25) Median [Min, Max] 27.0 [22.0, 30.0] racial abuse score Mean (SD) 5.59 (1.95) Median [Min, Max] 5.00 [3.00, 10.0] social identity score Mean (SD) 5.86 (2.61) Median [Min, Max] 6.00 [-1.00, 12.0] self-esteem score Mean (SD) 4.72 (2.00) Median [Min, Max] 4.00 [1.00, 9.00] CBT program efficacy Mean (SD) 22.6 (3.80) Median [Min, Max] 22.0 [15.0, 31.0] 2.1.2 Multiple Regression The following table provides all the numbers needed to fill in the worksheet. lab2.lm &lt;- lm(anxiety ~ socialid + selfest + raceab + CBT, data = lab2_raw); #Saving Linear Model in lab2.lm object summary(lab2.lm) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = anxiety ~ socialid + selfest + raceab + CBT, data = lab2_raw) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.9060 -0.8924 0.0391 0.8220 4.1153 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Coefficients Estimate: The estimated effect (aka regression coefficient). Tells us how much the DV increases/decreases per one point increase in the predictor (controlling for other predictors). Std. Error: The standard error of the estimate (regression coefficient). Indicates how much variation there is around the estimate. t-value: Displays the test statistic. By default, the test statistic will be the t-value from a two-sided t-test. The larger the test statistic, the less likely that the results were from chance alone.
