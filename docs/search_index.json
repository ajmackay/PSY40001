[["index.html", "PSY40001 SPSS to R notes Introduction", " PSY40001 SPSS to R notes Aaron Mackay 2021-03-10 Introduction The aim of this book is to go through each weeks PSY40001 lab and to recreate (or at least try to recreate) the exercises and output performed in SPSS in R. Depending on how intense the lab is (and how much spare time I have) I will aim to update this book before the following weeks lab. I have made this book public on github so feel free to download the code and add or edit anything. This book assumes a basic understanding as to how R and RStudio work, however I will endevour to make the steps as easy to follow as possible. If you have any questions then please feel free to reach out and email me at mackay_aaron@protonmail.com Enjoy! Aaron "]]
